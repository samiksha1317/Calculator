Simple Calculator using Python
This is a basic command-line calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.
Itâ€™s perfect for beginners to learn how to take input, use conditional statements, and handle basic errors in Python.

ðŸš€ Features
âž• Addition â€“ Add two numbers

âž– Subtraction â€“ Subtract one number from another

âœ– Multiplication â€“ Multiply two numbers

âž— Division â€“ Divide one number by another with zero-division handling

ðŸ“‚ How It Works
The program asks the user for two numbers.

It shows the available operations: +, -, *, /.

The user selects an operation.

The program performs the calculation and displays the result.

If the user tries to divide by zero or enters an invalid operation, an error message is shown.

ðŸ“Š Workflow
Take first number (num1) from user

Take second number (num2) from user

Ask for operation (+, -, *, /)

Perform the calculation using if-elif-else conditions

Display the result or error message
